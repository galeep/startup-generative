# startup-generative

startup-generative attempts to create a stream of random, plausible-sounding startup one-pager sites. This is a (shallow) fork of the random startup website generator by Mike Bradley and Tiff Zhang. 

### TODO
- Dynamic fetch of speech parts
- Fix garish transitions 
- Lots of refactoring

### INSTALL

Now with minimal container packaging,
TL;DR docker-compose build && docker-compose up
... and go to https://localhost:8043
